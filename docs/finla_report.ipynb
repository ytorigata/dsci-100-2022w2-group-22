    "Cardiovascular disease includes any condition that affects the circulatory system. This results in negative impacts on the function of the heart and veins, which differ from different types of cardiovascular disease (Thiriet, 1970). Cardiovascular disease is also commonly known as heart disease (Thiriet, 1970). \n",
    "In order to save many lives, it is essential that individuals with heart disease are diagnosed early to start treatment as soon as possible (Pal et al., 2022). A model that can accurately predict the risk of developing cardiovascular disease would have the potential to save countless lives (Pal et al., 2022). \n",
    "By narrowing it down to specific factors such as cholesterol or blood pressure we can possibly give advice on proactive measures that are most important to minimize risk of heart disease."
